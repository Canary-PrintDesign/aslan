                  <div>
                  <p>Pat and Lorne purchased a home done by a builder who saw no value in a nice landscape, despite the home being front and centre in town. The quality of the landscape was disappointing, given that it was part of a brand new built home. They worked with our designer to build a design that gave their home the curb appeal it deserved without adding any maintenance. As you can see, the results were wonderful!</p>

              <h2>Westridge Way</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Jim and Gabrielle had a custom landscape designed and built to match their taste. Their custom landscape is all about the details - small design elements that aren’t easy to re-create and aren’t often seen; a true piece of art. What makes their landscape even more special is the space that it was done within! A small lot by some peoples standards, but a great canvas nonetheless. Without a doubt, this is the favourite landscape we have ever done!</p>

                <div>
                  <p>Gary and Janice were clients who wanted to elevate the quality of their landscape by bringing an artistic flare to the appearance. We completely redesigned the front yard and installed a brand new irrigation system to keep the new landscape looking primo. Low-maintenance was a big selling point, so we took special care in making sure that everything was simple and clean.</p>

                <h2>Ridgefield Drive</h2>
                <div>
                  <p>Garry and Arlene came to us with very vague instructions. They simply said they wanted their current landscape to have more 'wow'. In the world of landscape renovations, 'wow' can mean sooo many things. The truth is they knew they wanted more but didn’t know what more looked liked. Some would think this is great - a chance to just be creative and “have at it”, but often the clients who don’t know what they want are the hardest to deal with. We presented them with a rendering of what we thought their new landscape should look like, which included a new layout that focused on curb appeal. The lot is a corner lot with high exposure, so it was important that the impressive parts of the garden were out for people to see. <strong> When we were finished, Garry said "I never could have envisioned something so colorful and grand!"</strong></p>
