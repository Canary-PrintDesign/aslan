Inspired by the breath-taking natural beauty of Vancouver Island, Aslan was founded over ten years ago by Chris and his love for creativity and outdoor space. Since then, a passionate group of people have joined him in his adventure of making every yard an enchanting space for every client.

## We live by our values
Each day at Aslan is guided by the same principles of giving exceptional customer service, keeping our promises, and continually innovating. We are solid on our word and we believe that every project deserves a creative solution.

## This is us
We are Aslan, and we want to tackle any challenge as an opportunity for improving ourselves and reinventing our craft. We take our inspiration from the magnificent scenery that surrounds us, and we want to cultivate a genuinely West Coast flavour in each of our projects. We are innovative, creative, and hard working.
